# Metashape_Optimize_Automator
This following script was written for the NPS AKRO Natural Resources SfM protocol pertaining to the gradual selection, error reduction and camera optimization steps with Agisoft Metashape. When ready to run this script, click on "Tools" in the top Metashape menu bar then click on "Run Script". Navigate to where the script is located and select it. While the script runs, pertinent information required by the current SfM protocol will be written to the Console window of Metashape, each line prefaced with "****". 

This includes number of starting points, number of points selected and removed during each step and total camera error at each step. The script can be run within the document with multiple chunks and will only apply to the active chunk.
